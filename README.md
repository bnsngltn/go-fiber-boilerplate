# Go Fiber Boilerplate

A generic boilerplate for the `Go Fiber` APIs that I am always working with.

This boilerplate contains generic handlers (protected and not), a jwt middleware and some basic [gorm](https://github.com/go-gorm/gorm) queries. 

Also contains some basic swagger documentations using [swagger ui](https://github.com/arsmn/fiber-swagger) and [swaggo](https://github.com/swaggo/swag). Don't forget to run `swag init` everytime you have new swagger docs.

Feel free to use this on your projects. Leave me a star if this repo helped you get started.

## To Add
- User Roles (User can have many roles, a role has many permissions)
- Manual Gorm Migrations
- Manual Seeding

Just raise an issue on this repo.

**Cheers,**
